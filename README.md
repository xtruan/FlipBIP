# FlipBIP - BIP32/39/44

[![Build](https://github.com/xtruan/FlipBIP/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/xtruan/FlipBIP/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Crypto toolkit for Flipper Zero
- Last built against `0.104.0` Flipper Zero firmware release
- Using Trezor crypto libs from `core/v2.5.3` release
- NOTE: This app uses very close to the maximum Flipper Zero RAM. If you get `furi_check failed` on launch, try running again!

### DONATE IF YOU FIND THE APP USEFUL
  - ETH (or ERC-20): `xtruan.eth` or `0xa9Ad79502cdaf4F6881f3C2ef260713e5B771CE2`
  - BTC: `16RP5Ui5QrWrVh2rR7NKAPwE5A4uFjCfbs`

## Background

The goal of this project is to see how much crypto functionality can be brought to the Flipper Zero.

## How to install on Flipper Zero
- If you do not have one, download a Flipper Zero firmware to get the `fbt` build tool
- Plug your Flipper Zero in via USB
- Copy the contents of this folder into the `applications_user` folder of your firmware
- ~Modify the `site_scons/cc.scons` file in the Flipper Zero firmware to add the `"-Os"` flag~

Then run the command: 
 ```
./fbt COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 launch_app APPSRC=applications_user/FlipBIP
 ```
The application will be compiled and copied onto your device

## Status

### Complete

- Trezor crypto C code ported into `crypto` subfolder
  - Adapted to use Flipper hardware RNG (see `crypto/rand.c`)
  - Imports and some C library functions modified for compatibility with FBT
- Navigation and UI adapted from FAP Boilerplate app
- BIP39 mnemonic generation
  - 24, 18, or 12 words configured in settings
- BIP39 mnemonic to BIP39 seed generation
- Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet generation from seed
  - Generation of offline `m/44'/0'/0'/0` BTC wallet
  - Generation of offline `m/44'/770'/0'/0` COSA wallet
  - Generation of offline `m/44'/60'/0'/0` ETH wallet (coded from the $SPORK Castle of ETHDenver 2023!)
  - Generation of offline `m/44'/5'/0'/0` DASH wallet
  - Generation of offline `m/44'/3'/0'/0` DOGE wallet
  - Generation of offline `m/44'/770'/0'/0` PIRATE wallet
  - Generation of offline `m/44'/133'/0'/0` ZEC transparent address wallet (by @wh00hw)
  - Similar features to: https://iancoleman.io/bip39/
- Saving wallets to SD card
  - Wallets are saved to SD card upon creation in `apps_data/flipbip`
      - NOTE: `apps_data` folder must already exist on SD card!
  - Saved wallets can be viewed between app runs
  - Wallets are encrypted with a randomly generated key, and that key is also encrypted
      - `.flipbip.dat` and `.flipbip.key` files are both required to be in `apps_data/flipbip`
      - Backups of both these files `.flipbip.dat.bak` and `.flipbip.key.bak` are also maintained
      - If you want to externally back up your wallet, I recommend copying all these files, and storing the `key` and `dat` files seperately
  - NOTE: The wallets should be decently tough to crack off of a Flipper, however any Flipper with the app installed can load a wallet in the `apps_data/flipbip` directory if both the `key` and `dat` file are present. Therefore, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to use the BIP39 passphrase functionality and store the passphrase in your brain or on paper separately from the Flipper!
- BIP39 passphrase support
  - Configured in settings, not persisted between runs for security
- Import your own mnemonic
  - Lots of typing required but you can now use the wallet with an existing mnemonic you have saved
  - Useful to convert paper backup to keys and receive addresses without relying on a laptop or phone
- Improved receive address generation features
  - Addresses are now generated at the same time as other pieces of wallet info
    - This slows down initial wallet load, but makes UI much more responsive
  - QR code files are now generated for each address and stored in the `apps_data/flipbip` directory
    - This app is required to view the QR code files: https://github.com/bmatcuk/flipperzero-qrcode
    - NOTE: This happens during the `View Wallet` step; you must view a wallet after generating/importing a wallet in order to ensure the address QR files are correct
- Broke out crypto functionality into its own library using `fap_private_libs` feature

### Work in Progress

- More coin types
  - Support for more custom BIP32 wallet paths

### (FAR) Future

- Custom wallet security
  - User specified password
- USB/Bluetooth wallet functionality
